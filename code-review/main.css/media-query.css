/* General comments */

/*
1. In the main-original.css, there are a lot of duplicated @media query entry points.
This is generally not recommended as it is harder to maintain.

2. Among all the defined media query entry points, there is a mixed usage of "@media" and "@media only screen".
This is generally not recommended unless specifically required in the business requirements.
It is an indication that the developer does not understand the difference between the two ...

A better approach is to create a separate css file for media queries only.
Also only define each media query entry point once.

Nevertheless, for this task of reskining the existing TTG portal, my recommendaton is to follow the existing pattern and
make minimum changes necessary. Use Chrome's "Web Developer" tool to avoid confusion created by the duplicated media
query entry points.
